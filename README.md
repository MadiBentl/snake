# snake
This classic arcade game is very close to the original. The user controls the direction of the snake's movements with the arrow keys. As in the original, the snake grows as it eats randomly placed food, gaining points with every food it eats. The snake dies when it either goes off screen or touches its tail.

In this version of snake, the user's score is displayed and automatically updated each time the snake eats. The score is reset to zero when the snake dies. A highscore is also recorded for each session.
